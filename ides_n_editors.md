# IDEs, Editors & Other things
#### published on: 27/Jun/2017

In ~11 years of my software career i have used bunch of IDEs and editors, some of them make you fall in love with them and 
some you hate to the core, sometimes it's only becuase it's NOT your favorite editor :)

I started my first job with Unix (HP/AIX/Solaris) and this was the first time i moved away from GUI based OS to fully CLI based OS. 
And as a newbie, i used to open all files in "vi" editor and mess up the file everytime I had to move to up/down/left/right 
and editing line between. I knew there has to be something better than this and soon i found "**Vim**" by go to editor on Linux. 
I use it till this date. I used it to do lot of fancy stuff in VIM, yanking, delete, macro and selecting all similar words and
displaying them .. ohh i am love with this editor. I was so used to it that i installed "GVim" on my windows machine back home. I still need to learn lot more about Vim to use it with its full potential but i am happy with this editor.

There is long battle between which is better Vim or Emacs? I am not going to start that here, as i never worked on it and don't 
have plans to do so in future. One thing i never did it with Vim is use it as an IDE. When i started using it, it was only for 
editing files, writting shell scripts and write small Perl script. So i never needed the auto-complete logic for this job. 
but soon as code started to grow big i learned that i need an IDE and Vim *may* support this but its not my choice of tool for this.
This is when i was working fully on Perl, First thing that i found was Komodo IDE from Active State. It was good but my code never 
went beyond 3-4 files (*i was more into writing monolithic applications*). This was back in 2008. 

I moved to my new job where I first time had to work with hundreds of files and it was fully on Linux without GUI. So no chance
of having any other IDE but just Vim. Sometimes having no choice is good thing. Few years later I moved to code in C#, yeah from Perl
to C#, there came the **Visual Studio**. So you can imaging moving from Vim to VS the feel of the IDE was really great.
With everything built-in it was great to use tool. And if you combine it with Resharper you feel like you have buddy 
helping you on bad code. I used to write for loop and wait to see how Resharper converts it to LINQ and learn from it.

I worked in C# for around 2.5 years and till date i think its the best IDE for a language and every language should have IDE like it. 
After working in C# next move was in C++ team, sadly there were not many IDE for C++, **eclipse**, eclipse is good for Java 
but not so good for C++ it tries its best but i never liked the look and feel of it. my stint with C++ didnt last very long 
i soon moved to Python and still working with Python. 

I learned Python on the job and then online tutorials, first IDE i ever used for Python Komodo at home then i used Notepad++ 
for writing small code parts. But both didnt feel right for the job. Around same time in 2014, i first heard about PyCharm 
and thought to give it a try but it was not free back then so i had to download the trial version and i liked in first go. Luckily
people at JetBrains (*company behind JetBrains*) released Community edition of this great IDE. 
Its my default Python IDE on Linux and Windows.

I worked on Java for brief period and used IDEA IDE i liked it (*maybe that's the reason i like PyCharm as both are from same 
company and have similar look and feel*). PyCharm is kind of heavy weight, so i was looking some light Python IDE, for which i 
checked out Atom and Visual Studio Code. Atom looks good but never got hang of it. As far as VS Code is concerned, i did not 
like Code in first go, i really didnt like the way preferences are set. 

There are times when you have to go back to something and give it a another try, VS Code is one who got another chance thaks 
to my laptop; I have a laptop with very low end AMD E Series CPU which is not even capable of running ubuntu Unity framework, 
so make it snappier i moved XFCE. Even with XFCE, running PyCharm used to take my machine for a toll so there was very 
urgent necessity to look for alternative to PyCharm and VS Code got another chance, after trying for day or 2, i am now using 
it full time on my Laptop. It lacks some of the great features for PyCharm but its allowing to work on my machine. VS Code with 
Python plugin is great. Now i am thinking if i should switch to VS Code full time and stop comparing it with PyCharm.

*if you are thinking what kind of Laptop is not capable of running OS & 1 IDE, so i have few apps running MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Robomongo, Chrome with at least 3 tabs open*
