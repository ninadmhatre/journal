# Guiding new joiners
#### published on: 29/Jan/2020

Recently we had few new joiners, they were all from different background with different level of exeperiece. Being bit longer
in the team i was tasked to guide them to be productive in the new role. I have done guiding few times in the past but everytime
i do it, it feels like is this the best way to do it? or can i improve (ofcource i can improve)?

After guiding new joiners with onboaring, I never received a negative feedback, so there are 2 possibilities, either i am really good
with this thing or totally bad so not worth sharing feedback. Being optimistic about (many) situations in the life i would go 
with the first case :)

## My start

I always go back to the days when i was just starting out, and i always feel what others could have done to improve my learning 
experience back then. I started right out of colleage in 2006 and then put on to work with Unix & Cobol. I did my engineering
in Electronics and never used computer to code before I actually started working. For first few weeks i was given really stupid tasks
since i never did coding in my life but when i think back about those tasks, those were really shitty tasks for e.g. open 5000 files
and manually categorise them in shell,sql,cobol and some other type. if this wasn't enough after completing this next day there were
11000 files. This task was so bad that i actually stared learning to code and diving into more challenging tasks. There i started
with Perl and my coding life started. My seniors back them helped me only after i spent some considerable time 
(ranging from few hours to couple of day) with the task this also helped me to explore new things and sometime break my head 
as well. But i liked the "breaking my head" over some simple tasks this helped me to understand the solution and remember it.
Imagin someone helping me as soon as i was stuck, i would have completed the task but would have always dependent on the other
person to complete the task.

## My Way

Like the way i started, i expect even learners to spend some considerable time with the task before actually asking for help. 
I mean they can certainly ask for help as soon as they are stuck but then instead of giving the final solution i just give them
hint to proceed further. This helps only when learners are just dependant on you but if you have more than 1 person who can help and 
wont mind helping you right away then people aproach another person directly.

Well this works for me as i can concentrate more on my task without getting disturbed but i would prefer to get disturbed than
creating the depedency on another person. In long run this extra helpfulness will bite us. I can ofcourse go and talk to everyone 
who can help and explain my strategy but like mine they also have some strategy which is different than mine. 

### Conclusion

I am not sure which is the best way to guide someone, but i think helping new learnes without letting them struggle is more harmful.
Helping might save time initially but then small time is spent everytime similar task is to be done and worst that attitude of 
trying to find solution on own is not created.
