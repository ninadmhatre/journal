## About Me

I am Ninad Mhatre, I am from Mumbai, India. Currently working as Python QA Automation developer in Amsterdam, Netherlands with FlowTrades. I am a software developer by profession since 2006, Traveler since I started earning, Amateur Photographer & Blogger by Heart!
                        
I am an Engineer and started my first job with TCS right after college in Sept. 2006. I started with Cobol as first programming language :) along with Cobol, I started working on Unix for the first time and I still do! I am huge fan of CLI and *NIX. On this job I was introduced to Perl (another beautiful language which is on decline now) I was so in love with Perl that I continued to work on it for next 4 years in my 2nd job as well.
                        
In 2nd Job or to be precise start of 2012, I realized knowing on one language is not good enough and started to learn other programming
languages, there came opportunity to work on C# to maintain and develop Windows based application deployment tool. I worked on C# for
almost 2.5 years but not working on it anymore, although i loved coding in C#. In my 6 year with JP Morgan, I worked on creating 4 application deployment tools written in different languages 2 in Perl, 1 in C# & 1 in C++, one replacing another :). During last project, I started working on Git, it was very tough to move from very simple SVN to complicated Git but after 2 months I was so used to Git that all my personal projects are on Git now. 

After working on building 4 application deployment tools and having very less knowledge about the business in spite of working in Investment Bank (IB) for 6 years, I decide to move to Automation testing team in order to learn business and improve my profile. In this role, I worked on Java, Selenium for initial bit and then I was again moved to creating internal website for the team. Which gave me opportunity to work on my favorite (at this moment) language Python which I used bit in last project and use it all time on my hobby projects. I had used Python previously but never for Web applications and there I first started developing in Flask. I am now full time Python developer since 2013.
